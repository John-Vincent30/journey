  <h1>MY 2ND YEAR JOURNEY</h1>

  <p>
    I am <strong>Cris Jay Soliguen</strong>, a 2nd year student at Cagayan State University Solana-Lara Campus, taking up a Bachelor of Elementary Education. I've experienced my fair share of highs and lows.

  <p>
    Being a working student as a barber in Centro Solana hasn't been easy – juggling classes, work, and personal life can get overwhelming. There are days when I feel like I'm running on empty, but knowing that I'm doing it to support my family and secure my future keeps me going. I wasn't immune to setbacks, though – failing in midterms was a tough pill to swallow. But I've learned to pick myself up, dust myself off, and keep moving forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this journey, I've been blessed with an amazing support system. My family has been my rock, offering guidance and encouragement whenever I need it. My friends have also been incredible – we've navigated the ups and downs of college life together, and their camaraderie has made all the difference. We've shared laughs, tears, and late-night study sessions, and I'm grateful for every moment.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what really keeps me motivated is my girlfriend, <strong>Lailanie</strong>. Even when I'm busy with work and struggling to keep up with my activities, she reminds me to stay focused and believes in me when I don't believe in myself. Her love and support inspire me to push through challenges and strive for excellence.
  </p>

  <p>
    With their love and support, I'm determined to make the most of my college experience and overcome any obstacle that comes my way.
